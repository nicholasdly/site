# {frontmatter.title}

Just like writers, programmers can face their own creative blockers.

Facing new problems and overcoming technical challenges is the fun part of programming. That includes debugging!

This is about knowing how to build, but having zero drive to actually do it. If that's you, you're not broken, and definitely not alone.

I feel it. A lot of developers feel it. I want to talk about how we can push through.

## Don't repeat yourself

Nobody likes boilerplate, and it kills momentum. Find the tech stack you're most comfortable with, then make a template that you can reach for on for every new idea.

It's important to pick languages, frameworks, and tools that are familiar to you. Ignore shiny new products. The most important thing is being productiveâ€”you can worry about polish later.

## Perfect is the enemy of good

If you're trying to get it right on the first iteration, you're doing it wrong. Being a perfectionist will slow you down, so leave the ego behind and just make something that works.

It doesn't have to be completely bug free. It doesn't have to be beautiful. *Ugly and functional beats elegant and imaginary.*

## Pace yourself

Touch grass. Burn out is real and it affects developers of all skill level. If you're not sleeping, taking breaks, or giving yourself the time to enjoy other things outside of work, you will never perform at your best.

Your physical and mental health are more important than your code. Don't forget that.

## Share your work

Nothing boosts motivation like knowing someone cares.

My girlfriend doesn't know a thing about software development, yet she loves listening to me yap about my work. That's love.

My developer friends might not have anything nice to say when I show them what I'm working on, but at least they care enough to criticize. That's love too.

This interest and care is fuel, fuel to make us do good work, and good work earns us users. This is the positive feedback loop every developer should seek.
