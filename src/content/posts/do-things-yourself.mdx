If you're letting artificial intelligence do the hard work for you, you're using it wrong.

Artificial intelligence was never meant to replace you. It was meant to make you more productive by allowing _you_ to focus on the hard stuff, while it knocked out the abundantly tedious tasks.

So if you're thinking about jumping on the AI assistant or editor bandwagon, take a moment to consider doing things yourself.

I've watched students throw entire assignments into ChatGPT, just for them to hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> and calling it a day. It left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.

Artificial intelligence became a gateway drug for procrastination and laziness. The number of students that actually cared for the learning material was dropping by the day.

When you're so easily given the answer to problems and you accept the answer without explanation, you are doing yourself harm. This is relevant whether or not you're using AI. You aren't engaging the problem solving parts of your brain, so your critical thinking skills become weak.

There's a reason why schools teach you things that you will probably never use in the real world: it works out your brain. And just like the gym, consistent challenges make you stronger.

Or smarter, in this case.
