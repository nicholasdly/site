# ⚙️ how this works

> this website was inspired by [alana goyal's website](https://www.alanagoyal.com/), which is based off of apple notes

## implementation

- this web app was built using [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a [react](https://react.dev/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) framework
- i'm hosting this web app on [vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- the notes are statically generated from markdown/mdx files
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) are used for styling
- this project is fully open-source and available on [github](https://github.com/nicholasdly/site)!
